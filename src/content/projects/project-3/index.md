If I had a dollar for every time I started a a project in godot, got a player controller set up and then lost steam when it came to making the environment... I'd be like 5 dollars richer. So for I decided to finally solve that problem by making my own procedural terrain generation system that I can use in future projects! You might be thinking, "Okay? Aren't there plenty of online assets/extensions/tools that you could get that do this for you", and yes, you would be correct. Why reinvent the wheel? Because whenever I've looked to use these tools they're either not quite right for what im looing for style wise, or too complicated to learn how to use them properly, and when half of your game project is just something you downloaded it kind of takes the excitement of building something yourself out of it. Plus i'm more interested in learning how games like minecraft, cubeworld and valheim generated their worlds for you to play on.
