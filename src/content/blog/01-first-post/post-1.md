## Welcome

Welcome to my new blog about my personal development journey. This site is meant to be a place where I can document what I’m learning, track my progress, and share projects as I work toward breaking into computer graphics.

To start, I wanted to build a simple personal site that I can use as both a portfolio and a sort of open notebook. Somewhere to write about what I’m building, what I’m struggling with, and what I’m learning along the way.

## What I’ve accomplished so far

### Getting started with Astro

To kick things off, I created this site using Astro. The main goal was to finally have a proper portfolio in place as I start getting ready to apply for “real” jobs and take the next step in my professional career.

I followed the official Astro tutorial from start to finish, and it was an awesome resource. It does a great job of explaining how Astro works without feeling overwhelming, and I honestly think anyone interested in putting together their own site could get through it—even without a ton of prior web development experience.

## Why computer graphics?

I’m interested in computer graphics because it sits at the intersection of two things I’ve always loved: art and engineering. I’ve always seen myself as a problem solver, and I knew early on that I wanted to be some kind of engineer. At the same time, I’ve always had a strong creative side and naturally gravitated toward art and making things.

Computer graphics feels like the place where those two parts of my brain meet. It combines technical problem-solving with visual creativity, and that balance is what excites me most. Being able to build systems that produce something visual, expressive, and tangible is what originally pulled me in—and what I’m excited to keep exploring.

## Where I’m at now

After finishing the tutorial, I did spend some time looking for free-to-use templates online. I could have invested more time designing a custom, minimal theme from scratch, but web development isn’t really my end goal here.

The site is more of a means to an end: a place to document my computer graphics journey. I’m eager to start working on graphics-oriented projects, experiments, and demos, and this blog will serve as a running log of that process. That said, building this site has been a fun side project and a good way to get comfortable shipping something publicly.

## What’s next

Next up, I’ll be shifting my focus toward graphics projects—learning, experimenting, and building small things that I can write about here. Expect future posts to dive into that work: what I’m trying, what breaks, and what I learn along the way.

Thanks for reading, and welcome along for the ride.
