While attending Oregon State University, I worked as a Nightly Operations Leader for the student-run SafeRide program. The role involved coordinating drivers and rides in real time to ensure students got home safely, while also supporting and guiding the nightly team. It was a practical way to develop leadership, communication, and decision-making skills in a live operational setting.
