During my summer internship at Marjin, I worked across a wide range of responsibilities in a small startup environment. I shadowed customer calls, built internal CLI tools for data scraping and processing, contributed to frontend tasks, and led the setup of an end-to-end testing framework using Playwright. The role gave me exposure to many parts of the software development process and what it’s like to ship in a fast-moving team.
